DNA test is one of the sure shot methods for telling if two people are related by blood, but it is time consuming, expensive and sometimes the DNA samples are not readily available. Furthermore, not everyone is privileged to get a DNA test done.  We humans can identify similarities between two people just by looking at them, and can tell if two people share similar facial features. As I can identify the similar Jaw structure in the above image. Can we develop a program which can look at the facial images of two individuals, identify any similarities between them and then decide if they are related by blood.
