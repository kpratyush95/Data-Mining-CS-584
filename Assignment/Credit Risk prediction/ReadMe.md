HW2: Credit Risk Classification is on Miner2.
Description:
************************************************

This is an individual  assignment with maximum size of 1.  Deadline is Sep 30, 2020 11:59:59 PM EST . 

************************************************

Overview and Assignment Goals:

The objective of this assignment are the following: 

Experiment with various classification models.
Think about dealing with data with different attribute types: categorical and numerical (ratio).
Think about dealing with potentially sensitive or protected attributes like gender, race, age
Think about dealing with imbalanced data i.e., class labels with varying distribution
F1 Scoring Metric
Detailed Description:

Develop predictive models that can determine someoneâ€™s credit risk 0 - high risk, 1-low risk .

The goal of this competition is to allow you to develop predictive models that can determine given a particular individual whether their credit risk is high denoted by 0 or low denoted by1.  As such, the goal would be to develop the best binary classification model.

Since the dataset is imbalanced the scoring function will be the F1-score instead of Accuracy.

Caveats:

+ Remember not all features will be good for predicting credit risk. Think of feature selection, engineering, reduction

+ The dataset has an imbalanced distribution i.e., within the training set there are 24720 (0) and 7841 (1). No information is provided for the test set regarding the distribution.

+ Use your data mining knowledge till now, wisely to optimize your results.

Data Description:

The training dataset consists of 32561 records and the test dataset consists of 13305 records. We provide you with the training class labels and the test labels are held out.

In the training file there are 13th attributes with the 13-th attribute (or column) being the class label of interest. In the testing file there are 12 attributes.

Description

id - unique identifier
F1 - Continuous value describing number of years since last degree was completed
F2 - Continuous value indicating hours worked per week
F3 - Categorical Value
F4 - Categorical Value indicating type of occupation
F5 - continuous value denoting gains
F6 - continuous value denoting loss
F7 - Categorical value denoting marital status
F8 - Categorical value denoting type of employment (e.g., Self)
F9 - Categorical Value denoting education type
F10 - Categorical Value denoting different race
F11 - Categorical - Female/Male
credit - 0: Bad, 1: Good

Rules:

This is an individual assignment. Discussion of broad level strategies are allowed but any copying of prediction files and source codes will result in honor code violation. 
Feel free to use the programming language of your choice for this assignment. 
While you can use libraries and templates for dealing with this problem. However, you should be able to explain these methods and their choice in sufficient detail.
You are allowed 10 submissions in a 24 hour cycle. 
 

Deliverables: 

Valid Submissions to the Miner2.vsnet.gmu.edu website  
GradeScope Submission of Source Code and Report: 
Create a folder called HW2_LastName
Create a subfolder called src and put all the source code there.
Create a subfolder called Report and place a   3-Page, single-spaced report describing details regarding the steps you followed for feature selection and classifier model development.  Be sure to include the following in the report:
Team Name Registered on miner web-site.
Rank & F1 score for your submission (at the time of writing the report).
Your Approach  
Your methodology of choosing the approach and associated parameters.
How did you deal with different features ?
Did you exclude any specific features ?
How did you perform model selection and which classifier stood out ? Any theoretical reasoning why ?
Was there a certain way you dealt with imbalance in the class distributions?
Archive your parent folder (.zip or .tar.gz) and submit via Gradescope for HW2. 
 

Grading:

Grading for the Assignment will be split on your implementation (40%), report (30%) and ranking results (30%).
