This is an individual assignment with maximum size of 1.

This is the famous Iris dataset and serves as an easy benchmark for evaluation. Test your K-Means Algorithm on this easy dataset with 4 features:

sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
petal length in cm
petal width in cm
and 150 instances.
Essentially assign the 150 instances in the test file to 3 cluster ids given by 1, 2 or 3. The leaderboard will output the V-measure and this benchmark can be used as an easy step for the main HW3.

The training data is a NULL FILE.

The file iris_new_data.txt, under "Test data," contains the data you use for clustering.

The format example is given by iris_format.txt.
